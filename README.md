This is a tool for drawing and editing images.

**Clarification:** This project is a modification of [EntregablePractico1](https://github.com/NahuFalconaro/Interfaces/tree/master/EntregablePractico1), on which I collaborated, with the aim of deploying it online and showcasing it on my portfolio.

This is a university project carried out in 2020 for the course "User Interfaces and Interaction" at UNICEN (Tandil, Argentina).
